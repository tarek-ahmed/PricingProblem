# PricingProblem
Computational intelligence solutions to the market pricing problem using the Particle Swarm Optimisation Algorithm and the Evolutionary Algorithm.

1.	Everything required to run the application is within the *Runnable* directory.
 
2.	Open the *settings.txt* file and enter the desired settings. By default, the console only prints the relevant test details
<br/>a.	For details on each iteration, set the ‘PRINT ALL ITERATIONS TO CONSOLE’ setting to `true`. 
<br/>b.	For details on the goods setup, set the ‘PRINT GOODS SETUP DETAILS TO CONSOLE’ setting to `true`
Save and close the file.
 
3.	Open the *parameterSettings.txt* file and enter the desired settings (by default, the file contains the best settings found for each algorithm during the investigation). Save and close the file.
 
4.	To run the application, double click on *PricingProblem.jar*. To run on a Terminal, navigate to the *Runnable* directory in a Terminal window and type the command: `java -jar PricingProblem.jar`

Once the application completes running, the result graphs will be generated in the *Results* directory.
